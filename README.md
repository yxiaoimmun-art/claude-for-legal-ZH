# Claude for Legal

Reference agents, skills, and data connectors for the legal workflows we see most — in-house commercial, privacy, product, corporate, employment, litigation, regulatory, AI governance, IP, and the learning side of the practice (law school clinics and students).

> **New here?** Start with [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) — install in 60 seconds. This README is the full reference.

Everything here is available **two ways from one source**: install it as a [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) or [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) plugin, or deploy it through the [Claude Managed Agents API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/managed-agents) behind your own workflow engine. Same system prompt, same skills — you choose where it runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every output from these plugins is a draft for attorney review — not legal advice, not a legal conclusion, not a substitute for a lawyer.** They are built with guardrails that reflect that: source attribution on every citation, conservative defaults on privilege and subjective legal calls, jurisdiction assumptions surfaced, and explicit gates before anything is filed, sent, or relied on. A lawyer reviews, verifies, and takes professional responsibility for anything that leaves the building. These plugins make that review faster; they do not replace it.
>
> **These plugins do not represent Anthropic's legal positions.** They are tools that help lawyers analyze issues. Where a skill includes a checklist item, a suggested framework, a risk flag, or a characterization of case law or regulatory guidance, that is an aid to the reviewing attorney's own analysis, not a statement of Anthropic's view of the law. The law in many of these areas is unsettled and evolving. The attorney using the plugin — not the plugin, and not Anthropic — is responsible for the legal positions taken in their work product.

What's in the repo:

- **Practice-area plugins** covering in-house, firm, and academic legal work — each one built around a cold-start interview that learns your playbook and a `CLAUDE.md` practice profile that every skill reads from.
- **Managed-agent cookbooks** for the scheduled, eyes-on-the-feed workflows (renewal watcher, docket watcher, regulatory feed monitor, diligence grid, launch radar).
- **MCP connectors** across general productivity (Slack, Google Drive, Box) and legal-specific systems (Ironclad, DocuSign, iManage, Lexis+, Everlaw, CourtListener, and more).
- **[Named agents](#agents)** — end-to-end workflow agents (Vendor Agreement Reviewer, DSAR Responder, Termination Reviewer, Claim Chart Builder, …) with job-style names and a single command to run each one.

## Agents

Each agent is named for the workflow it runs. They're the most common surface — start with the ones that match your work, then tune the underlying skill, the practice profile, and the connectors to how your team does it.

```

## Getting Started

### Claude Cowork

In Cowork:

1. Open the **Cowork** tab.
2. Click **Customize** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Browse plugins** and install the ones you want, **or** upload a custom plugin file (any plugin directory zipped up).

After install, skills fire automatically when relevant, slash commands are available via `/`, and the scheduled agents run on the cadence set in their frontmatter.

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace (use the absolute path to this repo or a GitHub URL)
/plugin marketplace add <path-to-this-repo>

# Install a plugin — pick the ones that match your practice
/plugin install commercial-legal@claude-for-legal
/plugin install privacy-legal@claude-for-legal
/plugin install corporate-legal@claude-for-legal

# Restart Claude Code, then run setup for each plugin you installed.
# This writes your practice profile to ~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/<plugin>/CLAUDE.md
/commercial-legal:cold-start-interview
/privacy-legal:cold-start-interview
/corporate-legal:cold-start-interview
```

**Run the cold-start interview first.** Every other skill in a plugin reads from the practice profile it writes. Skipping setup is the single most common reason a skill produces generic output. The interview takes 10–20 minutes per plugin and will ask you to point at seed documents (a signed MSA, a playbook, a prior review memo — whatever fits the plugin). More seed material is better; a **quick start** option is available if you want to be productive in 2 minutes and refine later.

**Start by connecting a research tool.** Everything else is better with one, and citations are unverified without one. See [MCP Connectors](#mcp-connectors) below for the full list — Lexis+, CourtListener, Trellis, Descrybe, and Solve Intelligence are the research tools the citation guardrails look for.

Updates: `/plugin update`.

### Claude Managed Agents

For the scheduled agents — regulatory feed monitor, renewal watcher, docket watcher, diligence grid, launch radar — deploy behind your own orchestrator:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh reg-monitor
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh renewal-watcher
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh docket-watcher
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh diligence-grid
scripts/deploy-managed-agent.sh launch-radar
```

Each template under [`managed-agent-cookbooks/`](./managed-agent-cookbooks) references the same system prompt and skills as its plugin counterpart. The deploy script resolves file references, uploads skills, creates leaf-worker subagents, and POSTs the orchestrator to `/v1/agents`. See [`scripts/orchestrate.py`](./scripts/orchestrate.py) for a reference event loop that routes `handoff_request` events between agents via your own orchestration layer.

> **Research Preview:** subagent delegation (`callable_agents`) is a preview capability and supports a single delegation level. See per-agent READMEs for security tier and handoff guidance.

## How It Fits Together

| | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Plugins** | Self-contained practice-area bundles — skills, agents, hooks, and a template practice profile. Install the ones you need. | `<plugin>/` |
| **Skills** | Domain expertise, conventions, and step-by-step methods Claude draws on automatically when relevant — and slash actions you trigger explicitly: `/commercial-legal:review`, `/privacy-legal:dsar-response`, `/litigation-legal:claim-chart`. | `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` |
| **Agents** | Scheduled or event-driven workflows (renewal watcher, docket watcher, reg-change monitor). Runs in the background, posts to a channel or writes a file. | `<plugin>/agents/` |
| **Practice profile** | Plain-English `CLAUDE.md` describing your playbook, escalation rules, and house style. Every skill reads from it. | `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/<plugin>/CLAUDE.md` |
| **Connectors** | [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that wire Claude to your data — CLM, DMS, e-discovery, research platforms, productivity. | `.mcp.json` (per plugin) |
| **Managed-agent cookbooks** | `agent.yaml` + depth-1 subagents + steering examples for headless deployment. | `managed-agent-cookbooks/<slug>/` |

Everything is markdown and JSON. No build step.

### External / partner-built

Plugins under [`external_plugins/`](./external_plugins) are built and maintained by their vendors. They install from this marketplace like any other plugin, but the vendor owns the code, the connector, and the support channel.

| Plugin | Built by | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| **[cocounsel-legal](./external_plugins/cocounsel-legal)** | Thomson Reuters | Westlaw Deep Research with fully cited reports — caselaw, statutes, regulations, Practical Law, and secondary sources across up to three U.S. jurisdictions per run. Requires a CoCounsel Legal subscription with the MCP connector enabled. Support: cocounselsupport@tr.com. |

## The trust layer for community legal skills

The community is building legal skills fast — registries like LegalOps Consulting's `lpm-skills` and Lawvable already list dozens. But nobody certifies community skills, and a lawyer installing a random skill from GitHub is installing code that runs with access to their matter files, their practice profile, and their research connectors.

`legal-builder-hub` gives the ecosystem the trust layer it's missing:

- **Security review** — hidden-content scan, injection detection, structural trust check on every install
- **Allowlist** — restrictive-by-default source gate (registries, publishers, connectors, licenses)
- **License gate** — deployment-context-aware license policy (personal / firm-internal / product-embedding)
- **Freshness gate** — tracks whether bundled reference content (regulations, statutes, procedures) has passed its verification window, and warns at invocation
- **Re-scan at update** — a skill that was clean at v1.0 and poisoned at v1.1 gets caught
- **Install log** — an auditable record of what's installed, from where, under what license, with what review verdict

The allowlist is restrictive by default. Permissive mode is an explicit choice. A non-lawyer gets routed to their attorney contact, not an "install anyway" button.

Community skills go through the same design review (`/legal-builder-hub:skills-qa`) as the first-party plugins. If you build for lawyers, run the QA against your own skill before publishing. It's the review a lawyer would do if they could read code.

## MCP Connectors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Connect a research tool first.** Every plugin ships with legal research connectors already configured — Lexis+, CourtListener, Trellis, Descrybe, Solve Intelligence, and others depending on practice area. You authorize them once, and from then on Claude pulls from authoritative sources and verifies its citations against current databases instead of relying on training knowledge. Citations that come through a research connector are tagged with the source. Citations from model knowledge alone are flagged `[verify]` and, if no research tool is connected at all, the reviewer note above the deliverable records that sources weren't verified so you know to check. The connectors are what make the cites trustworthy — set them up before you set up anything else.

These plugins ship connectors for the systems legal teams live in. A connector gives Claude the ability to read from and (where scoped) write to your data; the skills and commands use them.

| Connector | What it gives Claude | Plugins | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Slack** | Read channels, search, send messages and canvases | all plugins | Your workspace |
| **Google Drive** | Read docs, sheets, slides; fetch by link | all plugins | Your account |
| **Lexis+ Protégé** | Research, citations, shepardizing | `ai-governance-legal`, `legal-clinic`, `commercial-legal`, `employment-legal`, `ip-legal`, `litigation-legal`, `privacy-legal`, `product-legal`, `regulatory-legal`, `law-student` | Customer subscription |
| **CoCounsel Legal (Thomson Reuters)** | Westlaw Deep Research — cited reports across caselaw, statutes, regulations, Practical Law | `cocounsel-legal` | Customer subscription; OAuth |

## Claude for Microsoft 365

Lawyers live in Word and Excel. **Every contract-touching skill in this repo is authored to work in the Claude for Word sidebar, with tracked changes as the output mode.** That's `commercial-legal:review` (vendor agreements, NDAs, SaaS subscriptions), `commercial-legal:amendment-history`, `ip-legal:ip-clause-review`, `ai-governance-legal:vendor-ai-review`, `privacy-legal:dpa-review`, and the diligence extraction in `corporate-legal`. A reviewer accepts or rejects each change exactly as they would for a human markup — numbering, defined terms, cross-references, and styles are preserved.

The Excel-facing skills produce workbooks that open cleanly: `corporate-legal:tabular-review` writes a multi-sheet `.xlsx` with a sources sheet, `litigation-legal:claim-chart` writes an element-by-element claim chart with citation columns, `corporate-legal:entity-compliance` writes the compliance register with deadline columns, and `commercial-legal:renewal-tracker` exports the renewal register sorted by cancel-by date.

Install Claude for Microsoft 365 from **[Microsoft AppSource](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa200010453)**. Once installed, the skills from any plugin you've enabled are available from the sidebar via `/`, and connectors are reachable from the same surface. A single thread can span Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

For IT admins deploying the add-in against your own cloud (Vertex AI, Bedrock, or an internal gateway) rather than Anthropic's API, see the separate [`claude-for-msft-365-install`](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services/tree/main/claude-for-msft-365-install) tooling.

## Making It Yours

These are reference templates. They get better when you tune them to how your team works — and the customization mechanism is the plugin itself, not a config file buried in a repo.

- **Run the cold-start interview.** It **is** the customization mechanism. It asks how your practice works, reads your seed documents, and writes your practice profile. Every other skill reads from that profile. A `/commercial-legal:cold-start-interview` with five signed MSAs, your playbook, and your escalation matrix will make the review skills noticeably sharper.
- **Edit the practice profile.** Your profile lives at `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/<plugin>/CLAUDE.md`. Edit it directly for small fixes — a wrong escalation threshold, a new integration, a policy update. It survives plugin updates.
- **Re-run setup.** `/<plugin>:cold-start-interview` again for a full re-interview when your practice shifts materially (new jurisdiction, new CLM, new policy).
- **Swap connectors.** Point `.mcp.json` at your CLM, DMS, e-discovery platform, launch tracker, HRIS. Skills fall back gracefully when a connector isn't configured — no silent no-ops.
- **Bring your playbook and templates.** Drop your terminology, house style, and branded templates into the plugin's `CLAUDE.md` and `references/`. The skills will pick them up.
- **Fork skills for house style.** Every skill is a markdown file under `skills/`. Edit the steps, the gates, the output format.
- **Add scheduled agents.** The agents under `<plugin>/agents/` are markdown with a cron-style schedule. Add your own for the watchers your team needs.

No build step. Everything is markdown and JSON.

## Contributing

Everything here is markdown and JSON. Fork, edit, PR.

- **New skill** → add it under `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with the frontmatter the existing skills use (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`). Keep the description under 1024 characters — it's the trigger signal. The skill is invokable as `/<plugin>:<skill-name>`. Mark pure-reference skills `user-invocable: false`.
- **New agent** → add `<plugin>/agents/<name>.md` with scheduling frontmatter and the system prompt. Add a matching `managed-agent-cookbooks/<name>/` if you want headless deployment.
- **Community skills** → use `/legal-builder-hub:skill-installer` to test a community skill in your environment. The hub runs `/legal-builder-hub:skills-qa` against every skill before installing — it scores the skill against the Legal Skill Design Framework (nine design parameters, three legal failure modes, a trust-surface check) and rejects anything that fails.
- **Validate cookbooks before pushing** → `bash scripts/test-cookbooks.sh` dry-runs every managed-agent cookbook and lints orchestrator tool scope.
